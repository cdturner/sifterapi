Sifter Api wrapper
==================

December 2010: cdturner567@gmail.com

this wrapper covers the basic sifterapp.com api as published at this point.

All responses are converted from JSON format to standard .net classes which can then be handled with LinQ if so desired.


TODO:
verify all fields are named correctly to get their values in the deserialisation.....
